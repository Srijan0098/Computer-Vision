## Computer-Vision

This repository contains all projects and coursework done in my Computer Vision course.
In some of these projects, I have created custom functions that imitate the functionality of OpenCV functions. Other projects include implementing the functionality of the 'CamScanner' app, panorama stitching, etc.
